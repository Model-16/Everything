For public institutions, this metric is limited to undergraduates who pay in-state tuition and receive Title IV aid. For private institutions, it includes all undergraduates who receive Title IV aid.

Income categories are calculated from the income values used by the institution to calculate financial aid eligibility. For a dependent student, this includes the student’s and the parents’ income.

Separate metrics are calculated for 4-year institutions and less-than-4-year institutions. This metric is based on the number of full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates who initially enrolled in the fall term (for institutions that primarily follow an academic year calendar system) or any time during the academic year (for institutions that primarily follow a continuous enrollment or program-based calendar system). Institutions may exclude undergraduates who left the institution due to death, total and permanent disability, active military duty, service in the Peace Corps or other federal foreign aid program, or service on an official church mission (http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/glossary/index.asp?searchtype=term&keyword=adjusted+cohort). The entering class used in this metric depends on the highest degree offered by the institution (see ICLEVEL). Four-year institutions use undergraduates who started at the institution 6 years earlier. Less-than-4-year institutions use undergraduates who started at the institution 3 years earlier. Pooled figures include two cohorts of students."
